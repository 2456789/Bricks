A modern framework for developers who care about what to use and how many functions are needed on a project. It is a CSS (Sass) and Javascript based framework that have just the functions and components you need on your project. Supports open web standards and brings a consistent browser environment across mobiles and desktop devices. The Javascript library is adapted for modern browsers. The syntax is modular and inspired from jQuery.

**Use Bricks Framework if:**

 * You need a powerful library and components.
 * You care about "keep it simple".
 * You enjoy using custom libraries with what you only need.
 * You feel confortable using Addons

**Do not use Bricks Framework if:**

 * You need an ultra-complete-all-in-one javascript library (I recommend JQuery).
 * You need many components in one css library (I recommend Bootstrap)

*Current version: [1.0.1]()*


Getting Started
---------------
There are some things probably you are interested on. So, let's start.

### Browser support

* Chrome
* Safari 4.0.5
* Internet Explorer 8
* Firefox 3.5
* Opera 10

### History
Bricks Framework starts as an idea to create and use libraries with functions and components that you really need on your project. Most of actual frameworks are complete and covers everything, but sometimes they have more things that the ones you really need. Bricks borns from that situation. 

### GitHub
Bricks is opensource, so feel free to fork this project to help us to improve it. All the code is on public on Github:

[https://github.com/BricksFramework/Bricks](https://github.com/BricksFramework/Bricks)

### Support
Sometimes is necessary other ways to get in contact to talk and get support. You can send us a tweet to [@BricksFramework](https://twitter.com/BricksFramework) on Twitter, visit us on irc (#bricksframework) at freenode channel or filling a new [issue](https://github.com/BricksFramework/Bricks/issues?milestone=none&page=1&state=open).


Build
-----
### Dependencies:
You need some dependencies to start building Bricks Framework:
 * NodeJS
 * NPM
 * Grunt: ´npm install grunt-cli -g´

### Building
A few steps to build a Bricks Framework release:
 * Clone the repo: ´git clone https://github.com/BricksFramework/Bricks´
 * Install node dependencies: ´npm install´
 * Run grunt to start the build: ´grunt´
 * If everything is ready, you could get a copy in ´dist´ and ´package´ folder.

### Livereload
If you change any ´sass´ file, automaticly grunt will compile and minify it. Same thing with ´javascript´ files. Additional, it runs a localserver (http://localhost:33746) to see the examples, if you change a ´sass´, ´javascript´ or ´html´ file, the localserver will reaload to see the latest changes you made.

### CI
We use Travis CI to test every commit and pull request. You can check it at [Bricks Framework Travis CI homepage](https://www.travis-ci.org/BricksFramework/Bricks).
