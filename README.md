A powerful little framework for developers who care about what to use and how many functions are needed on a project. It is a CSS (Sass) and Javascript based framework that have just the functions and components you need on your project. Supports open web standards and brings a consistent browser environment across mobiles and desktop devices. The Javascript library is adapted for modern browsers. The syntax is modular and inspired from jQuery.

**Use Bricks Framework if:**

 * You need a powerful library and components.
 * You care about "keep it simple".
 * You enjoy using custom libraries with what you only need.
 * You feel confortable using Addons

**Do not use Bricks Framework if:**

 * You need an ultra-complete-all-in-one javascript library (I recommend JQuery).
 * You need many components in one css library (I recommend Bootstrap)

*Current version: [1.0.0]()*
